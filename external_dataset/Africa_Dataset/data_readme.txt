"country_code": Country code for location
"country_name": Country name for location
"supports_city": Whether API supports city targeting for location
"supports_region": Whether API supports region targeting for location

# - - - - - FB API data - - - - - 

Data for Monthly Active Users (MAU) in the location matching specified demographic criteria.
Variables follow the following general naming conventions:

A. [user_characteristic]_[age_group]_[gender](_[fm_ratio/frac/frac_fm_ratio])
B. [user_characteristic]_[age_group]_propor_female

C. FB_pntr_[age]_[gender]
	Facebook penetration (capped at 1) for the given 
	age and gender. 
	= (FB users in age, gender group)/(wpop population estimate in age, gender group)
	
	This is avaialable for:
	ages: 13+/15+/18+ (indicated as '13p'/'15p'/'18p') 
		  15-24/25-59/60+/15-49/18-24/18-49 (indicated as '15to24','25to59','60p','15to49','18to24','18to49')
	genders: 'all', 'male', 'female'

D. All_devices_[age]_GG:
	Facebook users gender gap for the given age group adjusted by the population gender gaps.
	= (female-to-male ratio of FB users in that age group)/(female-to-male ratio of population in that age group).


If the part in paranthesis is mising from variable name this means that the variable is the MAU count. Otherwise the data is either:
* frac: faction of users with the specified user_characteristic from all users in that age, gender group.
* fm_ratio: female to male ratio for the specified user_characteristic, age group and gender
* frac_fm_ratio: female to male ratio for the fractional features. 
	That is, frac. of females with the specified user_characteristic and age group divided
	by the frac. of males of the same user_characteristic and age group.
* propor_female: the fraction of female users of all users with user_characteristic, and in age group.
