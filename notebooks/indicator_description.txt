3) Social connectedness features

According to the SCI methodology, the "raw" SCI is defined as the number of friendship links between two regions divided by the product of the regions' respective user counts. The methodology states that the SCI can be interpreted as "the relative probability of a Facebook friendship link between a given Facebook user in location i and a user in location j". When we talk in the following of "friendship", we refer to this definition.

To transform pairwise connections (user_loc <-> fr_loc) to a cross-sectional setting, we aggregate for each user_loc across all fr_loc the "raw" SCI in different ways.
